Hi this is my "speedmatingapp"
I tried to do my best with abstraction and app structure.
I made some confusion with variable names, but nothing absurd.
I choose patterns and libraries that I use more often as to shorten the work on this I like MVVM more but I work with MVP more often.
The datasource is not asychronous nor it allows an error to occur, but the choosen architecture allow that to be implemented easly
The fragments' hierarchy it's maybe an overshot but I thought it would be a nice design choice.
I couldn't implement the list "this weeks" separators because of time constraints, same for the UI tests.
